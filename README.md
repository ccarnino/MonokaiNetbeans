# Monokai theme optimized for Netbeans IDE
===============

Monokai theme **optimized** for the **Netbeans IDE**.

At the moment the programming languages and files 100% supported are: 

- Php, Js, Html, Css, Less
- Others languages should be fine, but them have not optimized by me.


## Previews

See the previews of the supported languages [here](screenshots/).


## How to install
These instructions are for OS X, but on other OS are similar.

1. Open Netbeans IDE
2. [Download here](archive/master.zip) the latest version of the theme
3. Extract the archive
4. On the navigation bar, click Netbeans > Preferences
5. Open the tab Fonts & Colors
6. Click on Import... and import the **extracted folder**
7. Check All
8. Confirm and restart

Enjoy.


## How to contribute
To add new languages, branch the repository and edit the colours scheme **only** for a single language, then create a pull request. 

You should fix the colours for Syntax, Highlighting, Annotations, Diff and Versioning. So test them all.

Plus you should include a screenshot of Netbeans with a the filetype open (like [these](screenshots/)), and save it into the folder 'screenshot' with the name of the language.
